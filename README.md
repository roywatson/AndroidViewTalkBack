## **ComposeViewTalkBack project**

### Introduction:

We have been experiencing difficulties with TalkBack apparently as a result of using an `AndroidView` as a container for a Readium fragment. Due to the way Readium currently exposes it's functionality, as a Fragment, we have been compelled to use an `AndroidView` to contain it in an otherwise Compose application. This is one of the publicized raison d'Ãªtre for `AndroidView`. For our use case it is essential that the underlying Readium content in the `AndroidView` remain in place while being overlayed by user controls. The issue is that in Talkback the Radium content always "bleeds through" the layers above it so that tapping on benign areas in the top levels cause the TalkBack focus to be sent to the underlying Readium content, even through a higher level Surface. By contrast, with TalkBack disabled, taps on the overlaying surfaces and composables do not "leak" to the obscured Readium content below.

 This issue renders the app extremely difficult to use for the blind and the significantly sight challenged.

### Purpose of this Demonstration Project: 

A great deal of research eliminated a number of possible causes for the above observed issue. The end result of this research is that the issue appears to be related to `AndroidView`.

This project illustrates the difference in TalkBack behavior with and then without using an `AndroidView` as described below.

### There are two productFlavors:

##### 1) <u>withoutAndroidView</u>: 

This flavor populates the main screen with content generated with "standard" `@Composables`.

In this flavor, the overlaying "Scrim" shields lower layers from user interaction. Press any of the "Settings" buttons or the "BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON" button to bring up the "Scrim". Then attempt to tap on any underlying items, especially the "BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON", as expected, no lower level item will respond.

Repeat the above with TalkBack disabled then again with TalkBack enabled. You will experience this exact same behavior with TalkBack enabled or disabled.

##### 2) <u>withAndroidView</u>: 

This flavor populates the main screen with content generated with two `AndroidView` that are backed by view based content (ie XML layouts and programmatically added widget Button)

With TalkBack disabled you will observe the same behavior as described above for the withoutAndroidView flavor above. That is the expected behavior.

With TalkBack enabled, this flavor surprisingly allows user interaction to "leak" through the "scrim" to the lower layers. To reproduce, enable TalkBack then open the app and press any of the "Settings" buttons or the "BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON" button to bring up the "Scrim". Then attempt to tap on any underlying items, including the "BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON". Shockingly, tapping above any underlying item will cause TalkBack to focus on the hidden widget and read the hidden control's content and/or descriptions. Tapping where the "BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON" button is covered will allow you to close the Scrim by following the TalkBack instructions (double tap anywhere). This is not the expected behavior.  My newest push I simplified the architecture removing the viewmodel and as a result disabling the scrim close functionality on BUTTON BUTTON BUTTON. But you can still hear TB feedback on the button push].

It is interesting to note that when the scrim is visible, if you give the Scrim the TalkBack focus (or any of the "Settings" buttons in the topbar) talkback traversal (left and right swipes) works as expected. It traverses only through the "visible" widgets. For example, swiping right starting with "Scrim" traverses through "Scrim" -> left "Settings" button -> middle "Settings" button -> right "Settings" button -> "Scrim" -> left "Settings" button -> and so on. That is the expected behavior and is the same as the behavior when the underlying content is in a traditional `@Composable`. The traversal never sinks into the underlying `AndroidView` contents. So this seems to illustrate that `AndroidView` is being handled inconsistently by the accessibility service(s).

### Attempted resolutions:

I have tried many numerous combinations of `modifiers` especially semantics, including `onClick()`, `invisibleToUser()`, etc, etc. in various orders on the surrounding `@Composables` as well as numerous investigatations into programmatically manipulating the `AndroidView accessibility functionality (AccessibilityDelegate and AccessibilityNodeProvider) to make it invisible as well.Nothing attempted disrupted the `AndroidView's` contents from "bleeding through" the overlying layers.

### Conclusion:

Since `AndroidView` is a `@Composable`, it is reasonable for a developer to expect that it, and its contents would behave the same as any other `@Composable` in any context including TalkBack handling. The above experiments demonstrate that they do not. The fact that the above traversal exercise works as expected implies that `AndroidView` is in fact intended to behave as other `@Composables` and that the "bleed through" issue is an unintended effect i.e. a bug.

It seems clear that `AndroidView` does not interact with TalkBack in the way other `@Compsables` do. It seems equally clear that `AndroidView` does not properly interact with TalkBack in standard use cases.
